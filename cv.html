<h2>Profile</h2>

<p>I	am	an	experienced	IT	professional,	with	excellent	analytical	and	problem	solving	skills.	I	also	have
experience	mentoring,	managing	and	leading	teams	and	supporting	my	peers.	One	of	my	core
values	is	providing	exceptional	service.	I	consider	customer	satisfaction	to	be	the	most	important
factor	in	service	organisations	and	I'm	drawn	to	work	for	organisations	that	share	this	same	value.
I	am	quick	to	grasp	new	concepts	and	enjoy developing innovative	and	creative	solutions	to
problems.</p>

<p>My	working	experiences	have	allowed	me	to	diversify	my	skills	and	enhance	my	capabilities.
However,	they	are	not	my	end	goal	but	rather	serve	as	stepping	stone	towards	having	an
opportunity	to	work	in	a	development-oriented	organisation where	I	can	demonstrate	my	potential
and	passion.	I	can	communicate	effectively,	both	orally	and	in	writing.
I	was	recently	involved	from	start	to	finish	in	the	planning,	design	and	migration	of	an	entire	school
network	from	a	Linux	environment	to	a	Windows	environment.</p>
